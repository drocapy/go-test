# Understanding XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) 🚨💻

Cross-Site Scripting (**XSS**) is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into trusted websites or applications. This is one of the most common vulnerabilities found in web applications.

---

## 🚀 What is XSS?

XSS occurs when:
1. User input is not properly sanitized.
2. The application directly includes untrusted input in its HTML or scripts.

This can allow an attacker to execute JavaScript in the context of another user's browser, potentially stealing sensitive data or hijacking their session.

## 🎯 Example: Exploiting an XSS Vulnerability

Imagine the following vulnerable code in a web application:

## 🎯 Example: Exploiting an XSS Vulnerability

Imagine the following vulnerable code in a web application:

```html
<!-- Vulnerable Page -->
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome, <span id="user-input"></span>!</h1>
    <script>
      document.getElementById("user-input").innerHTML = location.search.substring(1);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Attack Scenario: If the application URL is:

https://example.com/?<script>alert('XSS')</script>

The injected JavaScript (<script>alert('XSS')</script>) will execute when a user accesses the link, causing a pop-up alert in their browser.

🛠️ How to Fix It?

1. Escape User Input: Ensure all user input is properly escaped before rendering it in the browser.
const safeInput = encodeURIComponent(location.search.substring(1));
document.getElementById("user-input").textContent = safeInput;

2. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF): A WAF can help detect and block malicious payloads.
3. Content Security Policy (CSP): Implementing a CSP restricts the execution of scripts from unauthorized sources.
  Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self';
